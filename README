Howdy. This is a prototype for a mobile Jogging app featuring an audio interface. 
To export to an applet from Processing, you must choose File...Export and then 
copy the Data folder to the same directory as index.html if it is not there already, 
as well as change the dimensions of the applet in index.html to match the dimensions 
in the pde file.

Happy joggin.
